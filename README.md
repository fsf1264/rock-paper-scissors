This is the first project where I test my javascript skills. It was not that complicated to make, although I think that it's okay for my first project.
It works entirely in the browser console, however I'm looking forward to updating it and making graphic interface for it after I learn how to interact with DOM. I will update the README file as soon as I do that.
